# Online-Auto-Parts-Store
It is an prototype of the auto parts website where the user can search and buy the parts by type, manufactures and the kind of parts.

How to run it?

In order to run this project you need to get the server as it is the php project so I have used the free MAMP Server. Download the MAMP server from its website and then start the server and goto "localhost:8888". Than go to my php admin and create the database by importing the auto_parts.sql file. Copy the project folder in the "htdocs" folder of the MAMP. Than go to "localhost:8888" and click on "My Website" and you will see the project there. Just click on the project and it will start running in the browser.
